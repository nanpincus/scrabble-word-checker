## Scrabble Dictionary

This provides a simple HTML textbox and button that will allow the user to check if a word is an acceptable word to play in Scrabble. If it is a valid Scrabble word, it will also provide how many points it would be worth on a standard Scrabble board (assuming no double/triple word/letter tiles..).

### Getting Started
1. Clone the project from GitHub.
2. If you don't already have Flask but do have Python, running *pip install Flask* in your terminal should do the trick.
3. Run startup.sh in your terminal to start the Flask's built-in server running on your local machine. By default, you should be able to access this at http://localhost:5000/.
